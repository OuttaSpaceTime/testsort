# Testsort

As my bachelor's thesis I programmed and evaluated a CLI tool written as a Ruby gem to prioritize test cases by coverage data of a Ruby on  Rails project.

- This gem is an experimental stage. Currently this repository is only advised to be used for educational purposes. 
- Further information on the used method, the evaluation and it's results can be read on [makandra cards](https://makandracards.com/makandra/609144-coverage-based-test-case-prioritization-in-ruby).
